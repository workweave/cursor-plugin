## Setup

1. **Install the plugin** from the [Cursor Marketplace](https://cursor.com/marketplace)
2. **Add your API key** in Cursor Settings:
   - Open Cursor Settings (`Cmd+Shift+J`)

   - Restart Cursor for the change to take effect
3. **Start asking questions** in Cursor chat:
   - "What's our PR cycle time this month?"
   - "Compare code output across teams for Q1"
   - "How much AI-written code are we shipping?"
   - "Who has the longest review turnaround?"

## Example prompts

| Question | What happens |
|---|---|
| "How is the team doing?" | Fetches code output, PRs, and cycle time for the last 30 days with trend comparison |
| "Show me AI code adoption over time" | Returns weekly `ai_code_percentage` time series |
| "Which repos have the slowest cycle time?" | Drills down into `pr_cycle_time` grouped by repository |
| "Compare our review quality to benchmarks" | Fetches `code_review_quality` with organization benchmarks |
